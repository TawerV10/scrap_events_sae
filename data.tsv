The North American International Propulsion Conference (NAIPC) is an annual meeting with a focus on business in the North American market. It is organized by propulsion and powertrain executives for propulsion and powertrain executives targeting an elite audience of individuals with levels of director or higher.  NAIPC will facilitate and encourage critical, open conversations that provide strategic direction for companies to prepare for what lies ahead in international propulsion sector. Between compelling keynotes and interactive sessions, attendees will explore customer perspectives, market forces affecting the propulsion business, and the impacts of new technology options and energy sources.  Attendees will also participate in the unique executive-to-executive networking opportunities.
The theme for the 2023 meeting is Driving Toward Carbon Neutrality.
The auto industry is striving for zero emissions and is in the process of transitioning from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicle (EV) technologies to propel vehicles. The auto industry is working to do its part to decrease carbon emissions to mitigate climate change impacts. The switch from a petroleum-based industry to an electric one has created many new innovations and disruptions that will be addressed at NAIPC.
It has been a long standing tradition for NAIPC to meet under the Chatham House Rule. 
The Chatham House Rule is used around the world to encourage inclusive and open dialogue in meetings.  
The Chatham House Rule helps create a trusted environment to understand and resolve complex problems. Its guiding spirit is: share the information you receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it. 
The rule reads as follows: 
When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

Testimonial
“I have probably been to over a hundred conferences over my career. Many of them have been focused on technology and technical developments. Others have focused on policy issues and objectives of a particular industry sector attended almost exclusively by the members of that industry. Some have been a combination of the two. In many cases government officials are viewed as the bad guy in the room, standing in the way of progress. The SAE Government/Industry Meeting stands out among them all as a very unique conference. It is designed to be the place that brings together leaders from a range of interrelated industry sectors and government to openly discuss and further understand the technical and policy issues being faced by these industries that are critical to their future.”
